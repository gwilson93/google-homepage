# google-homepage
From the [Odin Project's] (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css) Foundation path curriculum.

This mini project is designed to test building a clone of google.com with the use of HTML, CSS, and Chrome Developer Tools. This page is a simple form and the links and search functionality are not expected to work. This project is used to practice and develop my HTML and CSS skills.
